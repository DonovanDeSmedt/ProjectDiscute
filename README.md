# Project Discute

Discute is an application that is based on comparing 2 things with each other. While Mark Zuckerberg was at Harvard, he created a site that compaired female students. It had a great success but it wasn't female friendly.

This application is based on that idea but is completely female friendly.

##Left vs Right
The idea is simple, you upload 2 pictures and discuss about it with your friends. Who prefers what and why, this can lead to interessting discussions among friends or other people. You have a hard time making decisions? This might be the solution.

The look and feel are familiar with the other well known social media. You can follow your friends, view their posts and comment on them.

##World vs Friends
The application consists of the 2 parts, a 'world' and a 'friends' part. On the world page you'll find all the trending posts, furthermore you can search for things, people or tags. On the friends page, you'll see the latest posts of the people you follow.
